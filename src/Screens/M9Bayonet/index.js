            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-opacity-50 w-full">
              • <b>High Damage Potential:</b> The M9 Bayonet, particularly when
              utilized for backstabs, has a significant damage potential that
              can often guarantee a kill with a single well-placed strike. This
              makes it an exceedingly lethal tool in the right hands, capable of
              shifting the momentum in a game through stealthy and decisive
              actions. Its high damage output makes it a worthy choice for
              close-quarters combat, where gunfire might attract too much
              attention.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-opacity-50 w-full">
              • <b>Stealth and Surprise Element:</b> In CS:GO, the element of
              surprise can sometimes be the deciding factor in securing a win.
              The M9 Bayonet excels in this regard, allowing players to approach
              silently and catch enemies off guard, especially during moments of
              distraction. This stealth factor is bolstered by the fact that
              knife kills are silent, enabling players to maintain a lower
              profile compared to using firearms which can give away their
              position.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-opacity-50 w-full">
              • <b>High Movement Speed:</b> When equipped, the M9 Bayonet allows
              players to move at their maximum possible speed, enabling quick
              rotations and rapid repositioning. This can be a vital aspect
              during high-pressure situations where every second count. Being
              able to transition quickly between points or chase down an
              opponent can sometimes make the difference between victory and
              defeat.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-1">
              <b>Cons</b>

            <p className="text-white text-opacity-50 w-full">
              • <b>Limited Range:</b> One of the most significant limitations of
              the M9 Bayonet is its range, which restricts its usage to
              extremely close quarters. This can be a considerable disadvantage
              in open spaces or when facing an opponent with a firearm. Players
              need to be adept at closing distances quickly and utilizing cover
              effectively to get within striking distance without being
              neutralized.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white text-opacity-50 w-full">
              • <b>Risk of Being Outgunned:</b> Given its nature as a melee
              weapon, users are at a clear disadvantage when going up against
              opponents wielding guns. This necessitates adopting a highly
              tactical approach to engagements, where users have to carefully
              pick their battles and wait for the opportune moment to strike.
              The risk of being outgunned is ever-present, and players need to

              • <b>Requires Considerable Skill to Master:</b> Effective
              utilization of the M9 Bayonet requires a considerable amount of

              curve can be a deterrent for newer players, who might find it
              challenging to secure kills using the bayonet, especially when
              facing experienced opponents.
